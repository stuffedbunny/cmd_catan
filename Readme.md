### Setup

run `make` --> `cmd_catan.exe`

Optional commands (only use 1. In order of precedence):
- `-seed` to set RNG seed
- `-load [file]` to load old game (game is autosaved tos backup.sv)
- `-board [file]` to use board layout specified in [file]
- `-random-board` to generate random board (otherwise use layout.txt)

### Game Info
- Regular Catan game rules (Turn order: Blue -> Red -> Orange -> Yellow)
- commands: "roll", "load"
- currently buggy/broken as I try to get it working on windows (sorry!)
